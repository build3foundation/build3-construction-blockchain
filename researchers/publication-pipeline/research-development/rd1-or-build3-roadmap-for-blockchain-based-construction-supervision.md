### Abstract

This publication will discuss the roadmap for implementing a public utility supervision blockchain. This research would discover the complete road map logically from easiest to most difficult to implement. An example features road map may look like this (or some variation):

1. **Professional Licensure Authorship:** Cryptographic Signatures representing Architectural and Engineering Seals. This functions as the start of the identity network (proof of licensee).
2. **Construction Submittals:** Cryptographically signed by the issuer and signed by the reviewer(s)
3. **Permitting:** Permits signed on-chain by the submitting parties and signed by the approving authority having jurisdiction.
   1. Note: topic also may include thoughts about the International Building Code, Chapter 1, or other written codes that address permitting requirements. Nothing technically changes about permit applications and approval other than adding the blockchain's underlying storage and authorship mechanism.
4. **Inspections & Occupancy Certificates:** Similar to permitting, but for proof of the inspection authority.
5. **Operations and Maintenance:**  This concept is starting to look much longer into the future but is worth thought and documentation. Is O\&M a standalone network interoperable through a Polkadot (or Polkadot-like) parachain? How does O\&M tie to the original record of construction supervision, permitting, and occupancy approval?
6. **Property Identity:** The contributions from the build3 network related to proof of supervision would be identity markers about a specific property. Each renovation from start to end of a building would contain evidence of the supervision process that helped to secure the safety of the building itself.
   1. This newly found record of building history may tie into COBie reports and digital twin applications.&#x20;
   2. The incremental move into this phase of adoption would introduce conversations about insurance and lending, two major parties in the industry which rely heavily on underwriting risk.
7. **GIS Maps:** Proof of supervision of land survey work tied directly to the public GIS map systems. This use case is quite an abstraction from our original use case of professional supervision. GIS Maps is included as an example to help stretch out as far as we can reach for our purpose of identifying code compliance at the start of a building lifecycle and how that can extend throughout until the end of life. The objective is to postulate the demolition of an ideally chain-documented building. The land remains, but the evidence of the building is gone or nearly gone; however, the blockchain persists as a historical artifact.



## The Traditional Legal Road

One way to approach the road map is to consider how this could be adopted from a Statewide board perspective. This would require collaboration with the NSPE, AIA, ICC, and others that which have an existing respected relationship with regulatory bodies.



## Ok - let's move this faster.

PermitZIP being a bleeding-edge adopter, will provide much-needed test base information to help teach people how this works. There must be other organizations that would also be willing. An effort could be made to get 10 organizations with approximately 25 employees each also to volunteer to participate.
