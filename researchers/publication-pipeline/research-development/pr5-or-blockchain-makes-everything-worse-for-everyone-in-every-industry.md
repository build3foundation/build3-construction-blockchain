### **Abstract**

This research aims to dig deeply into those advocating strongly against blockchain technology and web3 in general for ethical, economic, social, or other notable concerns. Relentlessly exploring dissenting opinions is vital to the rigor of the research and will shake loose existential threats overlooked due to confirmation bias. With those threats identified, Build3 can work to resolve or mitigate them within the protocol.

* [**Line Goes Up**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ\_xWvX1n9g) - A two-hour documentary by Dan Olson with the general claim that blockchain technology is unnecessary financialization of everything that empowers capital holders fixes nothing, encourages fraud, and generally makes everything in the existing broken system much worse.
* [**The Third Web**](https://tante.cc/2021/12/17/the-third-web/) **** - A well-articulated summary discussing negative freedom, censorship, code-is-law problems, "transactionalism", and ownership. It discusses primary issues, including scaling, The Oracle Problem, ownership fallacies, climate destruction, pyramid scheme / bigger fool, and the general claim that VCs will fundamentally re-centralize the decentralized system.
  * From the website, "Web3 is a web of ownership. Every object is owned by someone, every object can be traded to someone else."&#x20;
  * _The above claim is not necessarily valid. Build3 is about authorship, no ownership. This distinction is the fundamental difference between the criticisms (generally focused on flaws inherent to fintech and so claims typically reside in the claim that blockchain is the_ financialization _of all things). The distinction is vital: Build3 is concerned with authorship for construction supervision authority._
